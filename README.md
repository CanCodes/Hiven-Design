# Hiven Design

Project is in early stages. More features and details will be added in the near future.

## Contributing

It's easy to add your design to the site for everyone to use.

1. Go to [/pages/index.tsx](/pages/index.tsx)
2. Find the edit pencil icon right above the first line of code. Clicking this will automatically fork the repo to your personal account.
3. Add your theme to the hivenDesigns array. Follow the format used in previous entries. On the left of the string, put the name of the design. On the right of the string, put the base64 theme code. Make sure these are seperated with a colon.

Thank you for contributing! I will be checking PRs daily.
